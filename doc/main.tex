\begin{abstract}
Translation of named entities is challenging for traditional machine translation systems, as there may be cultural 
or domain-specific references that may not be easily translated. 
This impacts the effectiveness of such systems in real-world scenarios. 
We draw inspiration from the SemEval 2025 Task 2 on Entity-Aware Machine Translation for this paper. 
The task was to translate an input sentence containing named entities from English to multiple target languages. 
In this paper, we attempted the task using various techniques and present our findings. 
We used prompt engineering to evaluate some closed-source models like Google's Gemini and OpenAI's ChatGPT. 
For open-sourced models such as Gemma, Llama and Mistral, we use prompt engineering followed by fine-tuning
to asses and improve their performance on the task.
We used Crosslingual Optimized Metric for Evaluation of Translation (COMET; Rei et al., 2020)\cite{conia-etal-2024-m-eta}
and Manual Entity Translation Accuracy (M-ETA; Conia et al., 2024)\cite{rei-etal-2020-comet} 
as metrics for evaluation of the quality of translation generated by these systems.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
The accurate and contextually appropriate translation of named entities remain a formidable challenge
for conventional machine translation systems, as these specific linguistic elements often lack direct
lexical equivalents in target languages. This necessitates a sophisticated comprehension of their real-world
referents and inherent semantic roles. This persistent difficult underscores the critical importance of Entity-Aware
Machine Translation (EAMT). EAMT represents a significant advancement, empowering machine translation systems to actively
recognize, classify and leverage an entity's specific type and attribute. By integrating this nuanced entity intelligence, 
EAMT can effectively resolve ambiguities, ensure consistent rendering across diverse linguistic contexts, 
and generate translations that are not only grammatically sound but also factually precise, 
thereby critically enhancing the overall fidelity and trustworthiness of machine-generated content
 in sensitive and high-stakes applications.
