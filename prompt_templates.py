    template='''You are a named entity recognition (NER) expert.
 
For each of the following English sentences, extract all named entities (e.g., people, places, organizations, TV series, movies, books).
 
Instructions:
- ONLY extract named entities that appear EXACTLY and VERBATIM in the sentence.
- DO NOT return alternate names, inferred references, or canonical forms.
- DO NOT perform translation, rewriting, or guessing.
- DO NOT infer likely entities or use context to deduce names.
- An entity is valid ONLY if it is an exact substring match found in the sentence.
- If an entity is not present word-for-word in the sentence, DO NOT include it.
- DO NOT return partial entities or reformatted names.
 
Output format:
- Return a single JSON array.
- Each item must be an object with these two fields:
  - "Source": the original sentence.
  - "Entities": a list of string values. Each string must be copied directly from the sentence. Each must be an exact substring of the Source.
 
Rules:
- DO NOT include any reasoning or commentary.
- DO NOT include any Markdown formatting like triple backticks.
- The output MUST be valid JSON that can be parsed by Python's json.loads().

You are an expert in Named Entity Recognition (NER). Named entities can be people, places, organizations, TV series, movies, books, etc.
 
Task:
Given a sentence and a candidate phrase, your goal is to identify the **most complete named entity** from the sentence that includes the candidate. This helps verify whether the candidate is a full entity, a partial one, or invalid.
 
Guidelines:
- If the candidate is a **subset of a longer named entity**, return the **full entity** from the sentence as-is.
- If the candidate **fully matches** a named entity in the sentence, return it.
- If the candidate is **not part of any valid named entity** in the sentence, return an empty list.
- Always return the named entity **verbatim**, exactly as it appears in the sentence (including casing, punctuation, etc.).
- Do not add inferred terms or modify the sentence.
- Named entities should not be a category or type.
 
Response format:
Return a valid JSON object with the following keys:
- "sentence": the original input sentence.
- "entities": a list with either the corrected entity string or an empty list if not found.
 
Constraints:
- Output only the JSON. No markdown, no code blocks, no commentary.
 
Input:
Sentence: "{sentence}"
Candidate: "{candidate}"
 
Output:

You are a professional translator with expertise in high-fidelity, fluent translations that preserve named entities.
 
Translate the following English sentence into {language}. The translation MUST meet the following constraints:
 
1. The meaning is preserved **accurately** and the sentence reads naturally to native speakers.
2. All named entities from the list {entities} MUST appear in the translated sentence.
3. Use **natural phrasing and correct grammar** in {language}.
4. Avoid literal word-for-word translation and aim for native-like fluency.
5. Do NOT hallucinate or modify entity names. Only translate using the list provided.
6. Entity translation is mandatory unless it violates grammar or meaning in the {language}.
7. If an entity cannot be translated after all attempts, only then include it in its English form.
8. The output must be a valid JSON string that can be parsed by the Python json.loads() function.
9. Ensure all JSON fields are correctly separated by commas. Do not omit commas between items or key-value pairs.
10. Do not include any additional text or explanations.
 
Format your response strictly as:
 
{{
  "translation": "<natural and accurate translated sentence>"
  "entities": ["<translated_entity1>", "<translated_entity2>", ...]
